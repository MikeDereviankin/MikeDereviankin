### 👋 Howdy, I'm Mike! I am one of the few formally-trained graduate chemists who has disguised himself as a data scientist in the fields of environmental, geochemical, biomonitoring, and arson investigations.

My objective is to promote the contextualization of large data to be further utilized by regulators, decision-makers, and litigation.
